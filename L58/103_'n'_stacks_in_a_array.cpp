/*
Problem Statement:  Design a data structure to implement ‘N’ stacks using a single array of size ‘S’. It should support the following operations:

push(X, M): Pushes an element X into the Mth stack. Returns true if the element is pushed into the stack, otherwise false.

pop(M): Pops the top element from Mth Stack. Returns -1 if the stack is empty, otherwise, returns the popped element.
